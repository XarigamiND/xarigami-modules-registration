# XarigamiND Registration Module

 The Registration module handles management of User Registration on your site, and options for user registration.

The Registration module is useful when used in conjunction with:

* an authentication module (in a default installation this is Authsystem in Core) that handles the users' login and authentication process.
* the Roles module that manages Roles on your site. Registered users can be assigned to roles that you setup and configure on your site.
